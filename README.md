# Abstract

## Workshop

In this Step-by-step Microsoft Cloud Workshop, you will migrate a Linux based application to the Azure Cloud. This will include the use of Azure IaaS Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Azure PaaS will also be leveraged including: Azure App Services (Web App), and Azure Database for MySQL. The attendee will leverage Azure Resource Manager templates, the Linux custom script extension, Github and a Linux Docker Container in the App Service.

## Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to migrate an existing Linux based deployment into Microsoft Azure and configure it for availability, connectivity, monitoring and general best practices with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Web Apps with Linux.

## Hand-on Lab

In this hands-on step-by-step lab, you will migrate an on-premises based helpdesk application called OsTicket to Azure. This will be a two-phase project to lift and shift the application into Azure IaaS and then migrate it to Azure PaaS. The application is Linux based using Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP). During the process of these phases, you will ensure zero data loss.


## Azure services and related products

- Azure VMs
- Azure Portal
- Azure CLI
- Azure App Services on Linux
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Resource Manager Templates
- MySQL Workbench
